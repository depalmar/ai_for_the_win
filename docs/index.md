# AI for the Win

### Build AI-Powered Security Tools | From Zero to Production

**25 hands-on labs** teaching security practitioners to build ML-based threat detection, LLM-powered analysis, and AI security tools.

## Why This Exists

Security teams need AI skills, but most resources are either:
- Generic ML courses that never touch security
- Security courses that hand-wave AI with "just use ChatGPT"

**AI for the Win** is different: you *build* the tools.

## Choose Your Path

| Your Role | Start Here |
|-----------|------------|
| **SOC Analyst** | Labs 04 → 06 → 10 (automate triage) |
| **Threat Hunter** | Labs 03 → 14 → 15 (find unknowns) |
| **Detection Engineer** | Labs 01 → 07 → 09 (better rules) |
| **Incident Responder** | Labs 10 → 11 → 13 (faster IR) |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/depalmar/ai_for_the_win.git
cd ai_for_the_win
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start with Lab 01 - no API key needed
cd labs/lab01-phishing-classifier
python solution/main.py
```

---

## Features

- **25 Labs** from beginner to expert
- **839 Tests** with 100% pass rate
- **23 Jupyter Notebooks** (Colab-ready)
- **Multi-LLM Support** (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Ollama)
- **Docker Ready** for easy deployment
- **Vibe Coding Friendly** (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot)

---

## No API Key? No Problem.

Labs 01-03 use traditional ML — completely free, no API key required. Learn the foundations before spending on LLM APIs.

| Labs | API Required | Cost |
|------|--------------|------|
| 00-03 | No | Free |
| 04-10 | Yes | ~$5-15 |
| 11-20 | Yes | ~$10-25 |

Or use **Ollama** to run models locally for free.
