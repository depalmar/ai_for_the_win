## Where Should I Start?

| Your Background | Start Here | Then |
|-----------------|------------|------|
| **New to Python** | Lab 00, then Lab 01 | 04 → 07 → 10 → 11 |
| **Know Python, new to ML** | Lab 04 | 07 → 10 → 11 → 12 |
| **Know Python, want LLMs** | Lab 08 | 14 → 15 → 16 |
| **Know ML, want LLMs** | Lab 13 | 14 → 15 → 16 |
| **Security analyst, want AI tools** | Lab 15 | 16 → 18 → 29 |
| **Want DFIR focus** | Lab 25 | 30 → 31 → 33 |

## Key Bridge Labs

These labs help you transition between major topics:

| Bridge Lab | What It Bridges | When to Use |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Lab 13** (ML vs LLM) | ML → LLM | If Lab 14 feels like a big jump from Labs 10-12 |
| **Lab 14** (First Agent) | Single tasks → Agents | Before Lab 16 if tool calling is new |
| **Lab 25** (DFIR Fundamentals) | General → DFIR | Before Lab 31 if DFIR concepts are new |
| **Lab 30** (Ransomware Fundamentals) | General → Ransomware | Before Lab 31 for ransomware background |

## Quick Reference: What Each Lab Needs

### Foundation (00-09) - No prerequisites
All foundation labs can be done independently. Start with whichever matches your gap.

### ML Track (10-13)
- **Lab 10**: Needs Lab 04 concepts (or ML experience)
- **Lab 11**: Needs Lab 10
- **Lab 12**: Needs Lab 11
- **Lab 13**: Bridge lab - helps decide ML vs LLM

### LLM Track (14-21)
- **Lab 14**: Needs Lab 08 (API skills) and an API key
- **Lab 15**: Needs Lab 14 (basic tool calling)
- **Lab 16**: Needs Lab 15 (full agent with tools)
- **Lab 17**: Needs Lab 15 + embeddings concept
- **Lab 18**: Needs Lab 17 (embeddings for RAG)
- **Lab 19-21**: Detection engineering labs

### Advanced (22+)
Most advanced labs combine skills from both ML and LLM tracks. Check individual lab READMEs for specifics.

## Still Unsure?

- **Try Lab 10** - If it makes sense, continue to Lab 11, 12
- **Try Lab 15** - If API calls are confusing, do Lab 08 first
- **Ask in the lab** - Each notebook has a "Prerequisites" section at the top
