## 🔧 Common Issues

### Import Errors

```bash
# Make sure you're in virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install missing packages
pip install <package_name>
```

### API Key Issues

```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   # Linux/Mac
echo %ANTHROPIC_API_KEY%  # Windows

# Or add to .env file
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" >> .env
```

### Data File Not Found

```python
# Use Path for cross-platform paths
from pathlib import Path

data_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data" / "file.csv"
```
